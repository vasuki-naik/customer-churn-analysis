Customer Churn Analysis

Customer retention is a critical challenge in highly competitive markets. This project delivers a rigorous analysis and predictive modeling framework designed to understand and mitigate customer churn for a leading telecommunications provider.

Project Summary

By leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning, this work identifies the key factors driving customer churn and builds robust predictive models to forecast churn with high accuracy. The insights gained enable data-driven decision making to improve customer loyalty and optimize retention strategies.

Key Highlights

Comprehensive Data Processing: Carefully handled mixed data types, missing values, and categorical encoding to prepare a clean, reliable dataset.

Addressing Class Imbalance: Employed SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to correct for churn class imbalance, ensuring unbiased model learning and better detection of churners.

Modeling Excellence: Built and compared multiple classifiers — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost — integrating best practices like hyperparameter tuning and balanced class weights to enhance prediction performance.

Rigorous Evaluation: Assessed models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC-AUC, providing a holistic view of predictive power.

Actionable Feature Insights: Extracted and visualized the most influential customer attributes driving churn, empowering targeted interventions and marketing efforts.

Production Readiness: Implemented model persistence for seamless deployment and scalability.

Business Impact

Enables early identification of customers at risk of churn, allowing proactive engagement to reduce attrition.

Prioritizes retention investments on high-impact factors, maximizing return on marketing and service efforts.

Supports strategic decision-making through transparent, interpretable machine learning insights.
